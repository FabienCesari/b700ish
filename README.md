# b700ish
A rough approximation of the Buchla 700 voice architecture in the Supercollider programming language.

Install Supercollider and follow the instructions at the top of the b700ish.scd file. Also, you will need to get the configuration images from Johan Boberg's Buchla 700 Archaeology page: http://randomvoltage.com/700/

Save each of the 12 color images of the configurations.
